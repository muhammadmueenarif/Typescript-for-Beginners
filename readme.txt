Lec 1. Introduction to TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that enhances the capabilities of JavaScript by 
introducing static typing and other features. It can be thought of as a superset of JavaScript as it builds 
upon JavaScript's syntax and functionality, while adding new tools for developers to create more reliable and 
maintainable code.

One of the core features of TypeScript is static. Typing in JavaScript variables can hold values of any type, 
and this flexibility can sometimes lead to errors that are difficult to catch until runtime. TypeScript solve 
this issue by allowing developers to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters and return values.

This means you can specify whether a variable is of type, string, number, boolean, or any other custom type 
you define. This information is then used by the TypeScript compiler to catch type related errors during development 
before the code is executed basically.
So this feature significantly reduces the chances of type related bugs and enhances the overall quality of 
code.

TypeScript also features type inference, which allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a 
variable if it's not explicitly specified.
So this strikes a balance between the strictness of static typing because static is just rigid. It's very 
strict. And the convenience of dynamic typing. Type Inference simplifies the code writing by reducing need 
for repetitive type annotations while still maintaining the benefits of type checking.

Beyond static typing. TypeScript offers a range of tools that improve the development experience. Modern 
code editors and integrated development environments Ides can leverage TypeScript type information to 
provide intelligent code completion, highlighting potential errors and offering suggestions as you write code.
This basically accelerates the development process, it reduces mistakes and encourages best practices.

Typescripts features go beyond types.
It supports the latest ECMA script features and can transpile down to various versions of JavaScript, making 
it suitable for targeting different environments.

Additionally, TypeScript allows for the creation of interfaces which define contracts that classes and objects 
must adhere to. And this promotes a more structured and organized code base by clearly defining the shape and 
behavior of different parts of the code.

The language also introduces advanced features like decorators, a form of metaprogramming that enables developers 
to enhance or modify the behavior of classes and their members. This is particularly useful in frameworks like 
Angular, where decorators are extensively used for tasks such as dependency, injection and routing configuration.

In summary, TypeScript is a powerful tool for developers seeking to improve their JavaScript projects. It offers 
static typing to catch errors early in the development process.
Type inference for convenience and the range of features that enhance code quality readability and maintainability.
Typescript's compatibility with JavaScript ecosystems, along with its ability to transpile to various JS versions, 
ensures that projects written in TypeScript can be used across a wide range of platforms and environments.
Whether you're building web applications, server side systems or other software, TypeScript provides an 
effective way to level up your development process.


Lec 2. Frameworks that use TS

Lec 3. TypeScript Popularity Surge
The popularity of TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript has reached remarkable heights due to its compelling 
features that cater to the evolving needs of modern software development. This demand is particularly pronounced 
in the realm of prominent frameworks such as Angular and React, which have chosen TypeScript as their language 
of choice for a multitude of reasons. 
Let's see, what are the advantages driving TypeScript demand?
The first one is type safety for robust code. TypeScript is most distinguished feature is its static typing 
system. Unlike JavaScript where variables can change types, TypeScript enforces strict type definitions.
This eliminates a class of errors during development and results in more reliable, predictable and robust code.

Number two, early error detection by catching mistakes at compile time rather than runtime. TypeScript helps 
developers find errors early in the development process. This proactive approach minimizes debugging time and 
reduces the chances of issues arising in production environments.

Number three. Code readability and maintainability. The strong typing enforced by TypeScript leads to clearer 
and more self-documenting code. This not only makes it easier for developers to understand the code base, but 
also streamlines collaboration among teams.

Number four. Code Editor Enhancements. TypeScript type annotations Enable code editors to offer intelligent 
autocompletion real time error checking and better navigation. Enhancing the overall developer experience and productivity.


Why major frameworks prefer TypeScript?
Number one is the scale and complexity handling frameworks like Angular and React are employed for building
large scale intricate applications and Typescript's type system becomes invaluable in such scenarios as it 
helps manage the complexity of these projects. The ability to define clear interfaces and types aids in keeping 
a well-organized and comprehensible code base even as the project grows.

So the second reason is team collaboration. Collaboration among multiple developers is intrinsic to framework 
based projects. Typescript's strict typing acts as a common language that facilitates seamless collaboration.
It eliminates misunderstandings, reduces communication gaps, and ensures that all contributors adhere to 
consistent coding practices.

Lec 4. JavaScript vs TypeScript
TypeScript and JavaScript are two related but distinct programming languages with varying features and

JavaScript is a widely used scripting language, primarily used for web development. It runs directly in web 
browsers and enables interactive and dynamic functionality on websites. JavaScript is dynamically typed, 
allowing variables to change types during runtime. While this flexibility can lead to quick development, it 
can also result in runtime errors that are harder to catch before execution.

While TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It introduces static typing where variable 
types are declared before runtime. This catches type related errors during development enhancing code quality 
and making applications more robust.

TypeScript offers type inference, reducing the need for explicit type annotations. It also supports the latest 
ECMA script features and transpiles into JavaScript for compatibility with different environments.


let's now explore the key differences between the two.
So the first difference is the type system. TypeScript has a static type system enforcing type definitions 
during development to catch errors early.
JavaScript relies on dynamic typing, which can lead to runtime errors that are detected only when the code executed.

Number two. 
So basically the second difference is the error detection. Typescript's static typing leads to better error 
detection at compile time, reducing the likelihood of type related bugs.
JavaScript errors are often discovered only during runtime. 

Number three Tooling.
TypeScript offers Advanced code editor support, including Autocompletion type checking and refactoring tools.
Thanks to its type annotations, JavaScript has more limited tooling support.

Number four code quality TypeScript type system and early error detection contribute to higher code quality 
and easier maintenance and JavaScript's dynamic typing can lead to more complex debugging and maintenance efforts.

Number five Learning Curve.
JavaScript's Dynamic nature can make it easier for beginners to start coding quickly.
TypeScript Static typing may have a steeper learning curve, but promotes better code structure and understanding 
among teams.


In summary, JavaScript is versatile for web development but lacks the robust error checking of TypeScript.
TypeScript Static typing and enhanced tooling lead to more reliable, maintainable and scalable code, making 
it a valuable choice for larger projects and teams aiming for improved code quality and collaboration.
