Lec 1. Introduction to TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that enhances the capabilities of JavaScript by 
introducing static typing and other features. It can be thought of as a superset of JavaScript as it builds 
upon JavaScript's syntax and functionality, while adding new tools for developers to create more reliable and 
maintainable code.

One of the core features of TypeScript is static. Typing in JavaScript variables can hold values of any type, 
and this flexibility can sometimes lead to errors that are difficult to catch until runtime. TypeScript solve 
this issue by allowing developers to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters and return values.

This means you can specify whether a variable is of type, string, number, boolean, or any other custom type 
you define. This information is then used by the TypeScript compiler to catch type related errors during development 
before the code is executed basically.
So this feature significantly reduces the chances of type related bugs and enhances the overall quality of 
code.

TypeScript also features type inference, which allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a 
variable if it's not explicitly specified.
So this strikes a balance between the strictness of static typing because static is just rigid. It's very 
strict. And the convenience of dynamic typing. Type Inference simplifies the code writing by reducing need 
for repetitive type annotations while still maintaining the benefits of type checking.

Beyond static typing. TypeScript offers a range of tools that improve the development experience. Modern 
code editors and integrated development environments Ides can leverage TypeScript type information to 
provide intelligent code completion, highlighting potential errors and offering suggestions as you write code.
This basically accelerates the development process, it reduces mistakes and encourages best practices.

Typescripts features go beyond types.
It supports the latest ECMA script features and can transpile down to various versions of JavaScript, making 
it suitable for targeting different environments.

Additionally, TypeScript allows for the creation of interfaces which define contracts that classes and objects 
must adhere to. And this promotes a more structured and organized code base by clearly defining the shape and 
behavior of different parts of the code.

The language also introduces advanced features like decorators, a form of metaprogramming that enables developers 
to enhance or modify the behavior of classes and their members. This is particularly useful in frameworks like 
Angular, where decorators are extensively used for tasks such as dependency, injection and routing configuration.

In summary, TypeScript is a powerful tool for developers seeking to improve their JavaScript projects. It offers 
static typing to catch errors early in the development process.
Type inference for convenience and the range of features that enhance code quality readability and maintainability.
Typescript's compatibility with JavaScript ecosystems, along with its ability to transpile to various JS versions, 
ensures that projects written in TypeScript can be used across a wide range of platforms and environments.
Whether you're building web applications, server side systems or other software, TypeScript provides an 
effective way to level up your development process.


Lec 2. Frameworks that use TS
Several prominent web development frameworks have chosen TypeScript as their language of choice due to its 
advantages in enhancing code quality developer productivity and project maintainability. Some of the notable 
frameworks that utilize TypeScript include number one Angular, so developed and maintained by Google.
Angular is a comprehensive framework for building dynamic web applications. Since its release, Angular 
has been a strong advocate of TypeScript. Typescript's Strong typing aligns well with Angular's 
emphasis on structured and maintainable code. This pairing ensures robust applications with a well defined 
architecture.

Number two React Created by Facebook. React is a widely used library for building user interfaces. While React 
itself doesn't require TypeScript, many developers and companies choose to use TypeScript with React to 
take advantage of its static typing features which enhance the predictability and reliability of their applications.

Number three Vue.js. Although Vue.js doesn't enforce TypeScript usage, it offers excellent TypeScript support. 
Vue.js is known for its flexibility and ease of integration, and using TypeScript with Vue.js can help maintain 
code quality and improve the development experience.

Number four next JS. So basically, Next.js is the back end framework that's heavily influenced by Angular's 
architecture and design principles. It encourages the use of TypeScript to build scalable and maintainable 
Node.js applications. TypeScript Strong typing helps prevent common errors in the back end code base.


Number five. Ionic. Ionic is a framework for building cross-platform mobile application using web technologies.
It leverages TypeScript to create performant and feature rich apps that can be deployed on various platforms, 
including iOS, Android and the Web.


Number six. Aurelia. Aurelia is a modern framework focused on simplicity and flexibility. It's designed with 
TypeScript in mind, allowing developers to easily integrate and take advantage of TypeScript features to 
create robust and maintainable applications.

These frameworks have recognized the benefits that TypeScript brings to the table, including enhanced code 
quality, better tooling, early error detection and improved collaboration among development teams. As a result, 
TypeScript has become a preferred choice for building applications in these frameworks, contributing to its 
widespread adoption in the web development community.
