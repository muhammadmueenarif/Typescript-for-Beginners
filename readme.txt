Lec 1. Introduction to TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that enhances the capabilities of JavaScript by 
introducing static typing and other features. It can be thought of as a superset of JavaScript as it builds 
upon JavaScript's syntax and functionality, while adding new tools for developers to create more reliable and 
maintainable code.

One of the core features of TypeScript is static. Typing in JavaScript variables can hold values of any type, 
and this flexibility can sometimes lead to errors that are difficult to catch until runtime. TypeScript solve 
this issue by allowing developers to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters and return values.

This means you can specify whether a variable is of type, string, number, boolean, or any other custom type 
you define. This information is then used by the TypeScript compiler to catch type related errors during development 
before the code is executed basically.
So this feature significantly reduces the chances of type related bugs and enhances the overall quality of 
code.

TypeScript also features type inference, which allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a 
variable if it's not explicitly specified.
So this strikes a balance between the strictness of static typing because static is just rigid. It's very 
strict. And the convenience of dynamic typing. Type Inference simplifies the code writing by reducing need 
for repetitive type annotations while still maintaining the benefits of type checking.

Beyond static typing. TypeScript offers a range of tools that improve the development experience. Modern 
code editors and integrated development environments Ides can leverage TypeScript type information to 
provide intelligent code completion, highlighting potential errors and offering suggestions as you write code.
This basically accelerates the development process, it reduces mistakes and encourages best practices.

Typescripts features go beyond types.
It supports the latest ECMA script features and can transpile down to various versions of JavaScript, making 
it suitable for targeting different environments.

Additionally, TypeScript allows for the creation of interfaces which define contracts that classes and objects 
must adhere to. And this promotes a more structured and organized code base by clearly defining the shape and 
behavior of different parts of the code.

The language also introduces advanced features like decorators, a form of metaprogramming that enables developers 
to enhance or modify the behavior of classes and their members. This is particularly useful in frameworks like 
Angular, where decorators are extensively used for tasks such as dependency, injection and routing configuration.

In summary, TypeScript is a powerful tool for developers seeking to improve their JavaScript projects. It offers 
static typing to catch errors early in the development process.
Type inference for convenience and the range of features that enhance code quality readability and maintainability.
Typescript's compatibility with JavaScript ecosystems, along with its ability to transpile to various JS versions, 
ensures that projects written in TypeScript can be used across a wide range of platforms and environments.
Whether you're building web applications, server side systems or other software, TypeScript provides an 
effective way to level up your development process.
